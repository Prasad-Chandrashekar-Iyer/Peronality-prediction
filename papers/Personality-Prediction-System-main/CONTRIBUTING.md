## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the Personality Prediction System. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports .

- Before creating bug reports, please go through the entire project as you might find out that you don't need to create one. 
- When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. 
- Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

## Before Submitting A Bug Report

- Check and understand the rest of the project. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself or might find out that you don't need to create one.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If the issue is closed, don't forget to include the link to the closed issue in the body of the new report.
-Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.

## Good Enhancement Suggestion

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to users 
- List some other projects or applications where this enhancement exists.
- Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.

## Your First Contribution:

Unsure where to begin contributing to the project ? You can start by looking through the issues labelled as good first issues.

**Good first issues**: These are issues that require few lines of code, non code related developments or a few tests etc.


## Pull Requests:

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to potential users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible version of the project
- Enable a sustainable system for Project's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- Follow all instructions in the template
- Follow the style guides
- After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

**What if the status checks are failing?**

If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

# Style Guides: 

## Git Commit Messages: 

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
